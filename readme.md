#IzayaBot

This bot is written in php and is intended to be used as a Discord bot account client. This is intended to have fun with your friends and make a bot say something in text chats. To get started, simply put the files in web directory.
<br><br>
Make sure your bot is Gateway identified or whatever.
<br><br>
For now features are very minimal, you can view what servers you are in, channel lists, and channel messages. You can also send Messages to channels.
<br><br>
The bot is named after Izaya Orihara, a character in anime "Durarara!!". Because he knows all. This bot knows all.
<br><br>
I'm also learning to use Discord api by working on this bot. More features to come!

Update: January 24, 2018<br>

2. Lots of features added, too lazy to document the rest<br><br>

1. Added baseurl variable for icons (under the hood thing)<br><br>
