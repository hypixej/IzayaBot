#IzayaBot

This bot is written in php and is intended to be used as a bot account client. This is intended to have fun with your friends and make a bot say something in text chats. To get started, add your bot token in config.php

For now features are very minimal, you can view what servers you are in, channel lists, and channel messages. You can also send Messages to channels.
<br><br>
The bot is named after Izaya Orihara, a character in anime "Durarara!!". Because he knows all. This bot knows all.

I'm also learning to use Discord api by working on this bot. More features to come!
